# OpenGLGGEDevelopment
The development of my GlorvanGameEngine for basic graphical use.


All I can say to people trying to read my code is: "Oof"
It works. Sort of. I can, and have, done some drawing with this. So it works well enough to create some stuff. Cant close the program properly yet, but you can save anything you make. I think there might be an issue somewhere with saving/loading but I'm not 100% sure what it is.
